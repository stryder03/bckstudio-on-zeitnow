Our website leverages the advantages of the serverless infrastructure commonly known as [JAMSTACK](https://jamstack.org). 
The original version was boot-strapped with the [NextJS Material Kit](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/nextjs-material-kit) 
template. Since then, the project has been refactored to better match React's principle of a component only doing one 
thing, and removing the use of SASS in favor of self-contained components that only pull from one common theme. 
The end goal is to create a lighter, more flexible template that does not require switching files to style components 
during the development phase.
